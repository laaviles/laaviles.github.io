# Looking Forward

Like I mentioned before, this class has exposed me to many fields and topics. I am looking forward to growing the seed of knwlege and skills this course has planted. Of the many goelas I have, I will describe three.

1. Take another woodworking class
     Ever since I was little, I have always been interested in wood wokring. I would be fascinated by the sotries my father told about how we would build furniture wiht his dad. When enrolling in this course, I had no idea i was going to have the opportunity to explore woodworking but I did. I attended a workshop in west philly that taught me how to build sheleves, and I was able to put them up in my aparment. i would like to continue taking more classes and discover how I can intergeate more wokrshops in generla into my life.

2. Use 3D printer
   For the critical making assigment, we used a 3-D printer to create our baseball field. It was awesome seeing all the different riters in the Education Commons and i was surpirse to learn that I could make use of those for free. My goal is to make a trophy in the shape of an english rider on a horse. For context, this year I was captain of the equestrian team at the University of Pennsylvania. As a way to symbolyze passing down the torch, I would like to make a little girt thta encomopasses what we do in the club. I think it's more special when a perosn of the team actually designed it and customizes it rather than buying one of the internet. 
   
3. Create my own website to document vacations.
   For this last goal, I would like to advance my knowledge of coding through the documentation of my vacation. I basically wnat to create an online scrapbook. Growing up, my mom would always create little photo albums with all theplaces we have been and this really inspird me to create my own. However, it is hard being a college studnet, with limited space and way from home crayying multilued of sticker and paeprs and paying for printed pictures etc. If I build my own webstie, I would be able to record all of those precious memories while also saving space and moeny.
