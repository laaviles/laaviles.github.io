# Looking Forward

Like I mentioned before, this class has exposed me to the art of storytelling through data. I am looking forward to growing skills this course has taught me. Of the many goals I have, I will describe three.

1. Take another woodworking class
     Ever since I was little, I have always been interested in wood wokring. I would be fascinated by the sotries my father told about how we would build furniture wiht his dad. When enrolling in this course, I had no idea I was going to have the opportunity to explore woodworking but I did. I attended a workshop in west philly that taught me how to build sheleves, and I was able to put them up in my aparment. i would like to continue taking more classes and discover how I can intergeate more wokrshops in general into my life.

2. Use 3D printer
   For the critical making assigment, we used a 3-D printer to create our baseball field. It was awesome seeing all the different printers in the Education Commons and I was surpirse to learn that I could make use of those for free. My goal is to make a trophy in the shape of an english rider on a horse. For context, this year I was captain of the equestrian team at the University of Pennsylvania. As a way to symbolyze passing down the torch, I would like to make a little gift that encomopasses what we do in the club. I think it's more special when a perosn of the team takes the time to design it and customizes it rather than buying one off the internet. 
   
3. Create my own website to document vacations.
   For this last goal, I would like to advance my knowledge of coding through the documentation of my vacations. I basically want to create an online scrapbook. Growing up, my mom would always create little photo albums with all the places we have been and this really inspired me to create my own. However, as a college studnet, with limited space, carrying multiple packets of sticker and papers and paying for printed pictures is time consuming and not financially sustainable. If I build my own webstie, I would be able to record all of those precious memories while also saving space and money.
