# Looking Forward

As I mentioned before, this class has exposed me to the art of storytelling through data. I am looking forward to growing the skills this course has taught me. Of the many goals I have, I will describe three.

1. Take another woodworking class  

    Ever since I was little, I have always been interested in woodworking. I would be fascinated by the stories my father told about how he would build furniture with his dad. When enrolling in this course, I had no idea I was going to have the opportunity to explore woodworking, but I did. I attended a workshop in West Philly that taught me how to build shelves, and I was able to put them up in my apartment. I would like to continue taking more classes and discover how I can integrate more workshops in general into my life. To achieve this, I will research the *West Philly Tool Library* [website](https://westphillytools.square.site/gallery) and check their workshop schedules for the next year. 

2. Use 3D printer  

    For the critical making assignment, we used a 3-D printer to create our baseball field. It was awesome seeing all the different printers in the Education Commons, and I was surprised to learn that I could make use of those for free. My goal is to make a trophy in the shape of an English rider on a horse. For context, this year I was captain of the equestrian team at the University of Pennsylvania. As a way to symbolize passing down the torch, I would like to make a little gift that encompasses what we do in the club. I think it's more special when a person of the team takes the time to design it and customize it rather than buying one off the internet. In order to create this I would start by downloading a[ premade model](https://free3d.com/3d-model/horseandrider-walking-v1--161141.html). Then, I would use Tinkercard to personalize it to my liking. 

3. Create my own website to document vacations  

    For this last goal, I would like to advance my knowledge of coding through the documentation of my vacations. I want to create an online scrapbook. Growing up, my mom would always create little photo albums with all the places we have been, and it really inspired me to create my own. However, as a college student with limited space, carrying multiple packets of stickers and papers, and paying for printed pictures is time consuming and not financially sustainable. If I build my own website, I would be able to record all of those precious memories while also saving space and money. I believe the first step will be to create a folder containing all of the pictures I want to include in onse specific page. Then I could use the structure of this porfolio as a guide to making my own webpage.
