## Introduction
Hi! I am Laura Avilés, and I took Introduction to Digital Humanities (DH) Fall 2024. This class has exposed me to many different areas of the DH world. In this page I will explain my interaction with this class and the things I have learned. 

## Statement 
When I registered for this course, I had no idea what to expect. The description indicated that we were going to code but assured beginners like me that it was accessible. The reason I enrolled was to learn coding basics, little did I know I was going to learn a lot more about data and how to interact with it.  In preparation for the first class, I realized that this course is not what I expected it to be. One of the first videos we had to watch was Finding Humanity in Data <sup>1</sup>, a Ted Talk by Giorgia Lupi. Lupi talked about data visualization and how to center it around humans. The topic captured my attention because I had never seen anything like it before, more importantly, I didn't know it could be an area of study. With her talk and throughout this class, I understood that each data set tells a story, our job is to discover and articulate what that story is. 

In the first class, we discussed foundational concepts: data, metadata, sorting, scalability, classification and overarching themes like ontology and epistemology. In this same class, we did an exercise of finding keywords (metadata) for specific images or articles. Initially, it was easy, but then it got more complicated because we had to consider nuance and perspective. The exercise reminded me of the video, Trans History, Linked <sup>2</sup>, which described the struggles of the *Digital Transgender Archives* in assigning descriptors. One of their challenges that captured my attention was the usage of offensive terms to describe an article. There was a lot of conversation surrounding the correct thing to do; whether they should use the offensive term and stay true to the historical context or if they should describe the work using modern words. This issue really interested me because I had not thought about it before. As a linguistics major I am familiar with how language evolves  but I had no idea how this cycle of language use could so greatly affect the area of data recording and metadata creation.

We did a field trip to the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts. There I was able to see how data was recorded and visualized in the past. I saw an old women's prison book and it surprised me how much it looked like a modern excel sheet. This revealed parallels between the past and the present in the ways of organizing information. Another book that intrigued me was *Bem’s Charts of Chronology by Elizabeth Peabody*.  The interactive book had empty grids that were meant to be colored depending on the group of people who experienced certain events, such as wars, ascensions, and death.  This book is a great example of a mix between pedagogy and data visualization to offer a unique way of processing historical data. I think this was one of the coolest books I have ever seen. I find it fascinating how such an inventive tool existed long before modern visualization technologies. This excursion to the library definitely affirmed my interest in history, specifically how we used to do things in the past, and how the old technology we invented but has fallen out of use.

Similarly, our field trip to [Eastern State Penitentiary (ESP)](espimages.html) affirmed my interests in museums and interactive storytelling. At ESP, I was able to see the behind the scenes of the transformation of ruins into a place of education and memory. This experience informed our critical making assignment. Our [project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17Cz-xajMRvpZH50ABpU-6DRXRnzGDj27lHMO9cTO_kY/edit?usp=sharing) involved choosing specific articles that described the baseball league of 1913 and linking them to NFC tags that were placed onto a 3-D printed version of the ESP baseball field. I enjoyed this project because it gave me an idea of how much thought goes into curating a data set to be able to tell a story. In addtion, this project taught me how to work as a team and recognize we all have different strengths. As someone who finds pleasure in dividing big tasks into smaller ones, project manager was the perfect role for me. My leadership skills helped guide my team in the discussions and assess what needed to be done and when. With the help of Sophie, we did a great job at curating those articles and being intentional about their order on the baseball field model. If I were to change anything from this project, I would make the model bigger in order to properly fit a phone between the two buildings to be able read the last NFC tag (4).

The [multimedia essay assignment](https://printinginprisons.org/blog/aviles/) was another exercise of interacting with data through storytelling. I decided to write about American expansionism at ESP, specifically how these ideas were represented in *The Umpire*.  This essay taught me how to carefully craft a story by connecting the small amount of data I could find. Writing this piece was a challenge for me because it was my first time crafting an essay with so little information, but I was pleased with the end result. I incorporated a picture of the article I analyzed, however, if I could revise it I would change how the picture fits into the website and add more images to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage. Overall, I would focus on better integrating the media elements into the design. I believe all I need is more practice with coding, using mardown syntax, and learning all the ways an image can be coded into the page. Aside from storytelling, I also learned how to do archival research. As practice, we were tasked with creating the metadata for specific articles in Reformatory Records. In the end we had a massive [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bnEvYe_KdwORTZ8Mto2lk6d_GJ--EIxUUJB60C7f8qE/edit?usp=sharing) with hundreds of described articles. For my essay, I had to scour the internet for a newspaper called Boston Evening Transcript. I was unable to find the specific issue I wanted but I learned how to use the clues of the dates given in my article to deduce when the newspaper could have been printed. 

Outside of class, we were required to attend two workshops. I went to a woodworking class in West Philly. Perosnally, I do not think it related a lot to this digital humanities class since I was working physical objects. However, it served its purpose in getting me interested in woodworking. The second workshop I attended was about coding and board games. The purpose was to draw parallels between the two. This relates more to the class since we had been working on coding for the multimedia essay. Both workshops expanded my knowledge of different topics and instilled in me a curiosity to expand to more workshops in general.  

Reflecting on the entire class, I noticed some clear themes and patterns. One recurring topic was the ethical considerations of working with data, regarding the way it is represented and its accuracy. From metadata, crafting stories, and digitizing archives, we returned to the question of who controlled the narrative and with what purpose. Digital humanities is much more than I expected. Another theme I encountered was the relationship between history and technology. Not just using technology to record history, but the history of technology itself. For example, not only did we learn how to work in HTML and markdown syntax, but we also learned about the history behind them.

At the start of the course I thought digital humanities was primarily about using technology to analyze text and create visualizations. Now I see it as a field that merges storytelling with data and history. It is about using digital tools to explore human experiences while still remaining aware of the implications of those tools. This class also helped me discover new interests and affirm existing ones. The visit to the Kislak Center deepened my appreciation for historical artifacts that use different methods of organizing knowledge, while the critical making assignment reminded me of my own interest in museums and interactive exhibits. 

Looking back at my work, I am proud of the thoughtfulness I brought to projects like the critical making assignment and the multimedia essay. I recognize I have areas of improvement like spending more time refining the visual aspects of the essay and trying different ways to create a physical model. Overall, this course reshaped my understanding of digital humanities. It taught me that data can be more than just numbers, it can be a tool for storytelling and understanding the human experience.
