## Introduction
Hi! I am Laura Avilés, and I took Introduction to Digital Humanities fall 2024. This class has exposed me to many different areas of the DH world. In this page I will explain my interaction with this class and the things I have learned. 

## Statement 
When I registered for this course, I had no idea what to expect. The description indicated that we were going to code but assured beginners like me that it was accessible. The reason I enrolled was to learn coding basics, little did I know I was going to learn a lot more about data and how to interact with it.  In preparation for the first class, I realized that this course is not what I expected it to be. One of the first videos we had to watch was Finding Humanity in Data <sup>1</sup>, a Ted Talk by Giorgia Lupi. Lupi talked about data visualization and how to center it around humans. The topic captured my attention because I had never seen anything like it before, more importantly, I didn't know it could be an area of study. With her talk and throughout this class, I understood that each data set tells a story, our job is to discover and articulate what that story is. 

In the first class, we discussed foundational concepts: data, metadata, sorting, scalability and classification and overarching themes like ontology and epistemology. In this same class, we did an exercise of finding keywords (metadata) for specific images or articles. Initially, it was easy but then it got more complicated because we had to consider nuance and perspective. The exercise reminded me of the video, Trans History, Linked <sup>2</sup>, which described the struggles of the Digital Transgender Archives in assigning descriptors. One of their challenges that captured my attention was the usage of offensive terms to describe an article. There was a lot of conversation surrounding the correct thing to do; whether they should use the offensive term and stay true to the historical context or if they should describe the work using modern words. This issue really interested me because I had not thought about it before. As a linguistics major I am familiar with how language evolves  but I had no idea how this cycle of language use could so greatly affect the area of data recording and metadata creation.

We did a field trip to the Kislak Center for special collections, rare books and manuscripts. There I was able to see how data was recorded and visualized in the past. I saw an old women's prison book and it surprised me how much it looked like a modern excel sheet. This revealed parallels between the past and the present in the ways of organizing information. Another book that got me curious was Bem’s Charts of Chronology by Elizabeth Peabody.  The interactive book had empty grids that were meant to be colored depending on the group of people who experienced certain events like wars, ascensions, and death.  This book is a great example of a mix between pedagogy and data visualization to offer a unique way of processing historical data. I think this was one of the coolest books I have ever seen. I find it fascinating how such an inventive tool existed long before modern visualization technologies. This excursion to the library definitely affirmed my interest in history, specifically how we used to do things in the past, the old technology we invented but have fallen out of use.

Similarly our field trip to Eastern State Penitentiary (ESP)  affirmed my interests in museums and interactive storytelling. At ESP, I was able to see the behind the scenes of the transformation of ruins into a place of education and memory. This experience informed our critical making assignment. Our project involved choosing specific articles that described the baseball league of 1913 and linking them to NFC tags that were placed onto a 3-D printed version of the ESP baseball field. 	I enjoyed this project because it gave me an idea of how much thought goes into curating a data set to be able to tell a story. I think we did a great job at curating those articles and placing them on their designated bases to add narrative depth to the viewers sequential reading.

The multimedia essay assignment was another exercise of interacting with data through storytelling. I decided to write about American expansionism at ESP, specifically how these ideas were represented in The Umpire.  This essay taught me how to carefully craft a story by connecting the small amount of data I could find. Writing this piece was a challenge for me because it was my first time crafting an essay with so little information but I was pleased with the end result.  I also had to incorporate media, so I chose a picture of the article I analyzed but if I could revise it I would change how the picture fits into the website and  add other pictures related to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage. Overall I would focus on better integrating the media elements into the design. I think all I need is more practice with coding in MML and learning all the ways an image can be coded into the page. 

Reflecting on the entire class, I noticed some clear themes and patterns. One recurring topic was the ethical considerations of working with data, regarding the way it's represented and its accuracy.   From metadata, crafting stories, and digitizing archives, we returned to the question of who controlled the narrative and with what purpose. Digital humanities is much more than I expected. Another theme I encountered  was the relationship between history and technology. No just using technology to record history but the history of technology itself. For example, not only did we learn how to work in HTML and MML, but we also learned about the history behind it.

At the start of the course I thought digital humanities was primarily about using technology to analyze text and create visualizations. Now I see it as a field that merges storytelling, with data and history. It’s about using digital tools to explore human experiences while still remaining aware of the implications of those tools. This class also helped me discover new interests and affirm existing ones. The visit to the Kislak center deepened my appreciation for historical artifacts that use different methods of organizing knowledge while the critical making assignment reminded me of my own interest in museums and interactive exhibits. 

Looking back at my work, I’m proud of the thoughtfulness I brought to projects like the critical making assignment and the multimedia essay. I recognize I have areas of improvement like spending more time refining the visual aspects of the essay and trying different ways to represent the data. Overall, this course reshaped my understanding of digital humanities. It taught me that data can be more than just numbers, it can be a tool for storytelling and understanding the human experience.
